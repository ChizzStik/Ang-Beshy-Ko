# Ang-Beshy-Ko
This is an entry to new trends of what I see in social media.
I created this because I was amazed at how easy to put emoji between words you make.
The code is messy and only in 1 file, with CSS and javascript.

Verdicts are accepted, I am not a programmer but I experienced coding when im in senior high school.
