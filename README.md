# Ang-Beshy-Ko
This is an entry to new trends of what I see in social media
I created this because I was amazed on how easy to put emoji between words you make
The code is messy and only in 1 file, with css and javascript.

Verdict are accepted, I am not a programmer but I expeirence to code when im in senior high school.
